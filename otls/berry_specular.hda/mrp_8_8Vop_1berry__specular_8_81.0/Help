=Berry Microfacet Specular Model=

Beeing compared to GGX model, this one have a much longer tails.

Do not forget to multiply resulting BSDF to value near 0.35 for metals to avoid too bright albedo.
For dielectrics, if recommended values of Fresnel0 parameter are used, total albedo is already in plausible range.

@parameters

Roughness:
    Roughness of a surface. Zero means "almost ideal" mirror, One is very rough surface.
    Values more than one are allowed, but will have bad sampling and very dark due to large shadowing term

Fresnel0:
    Reflectance of a surface absolutely perpindicular to light (and viewer)

== Roughness examples ==
Mirror:
    0.01
Almost diffuse:
    0.7

== Fresnel0 values for most common materials ==

Water:
    0.02
Plastic / Glass (Low):
    0.03
Plastic High:
    0.05
Glass (High) / Ruby :
    0.08
Diamond:
    0.17
Iron:
    0.56, 0.57, 0.58
Copper:
    0.95, 0.64, 0.54
Gold:
    1.0, 0.71, 0.29
Aluminium:
    0.91, 0.92, 0.92
Silver:
    0.95, 0.93, 0.88
