=GGX Microfacet Glass Model=

Combined both Specular and Transmission terms with a physically based Fresnel function to provide a
physically plausible Rough Dielectric BSDF

Beeing compared to Phong model, this one have a much narrower peak and longer tail at some time.

Do not forget to multiply resulting BSDF to value near 0.35 for metals to avoid too bright albedo.
For dielectrics, if recommended values of Fresnel0 parameter are used, total albedo is already in plausible range.

@parameters

Reflection Label:
    #id: reflectlabel

    Specifies a label for the reflection BSDF. This can be used to export
    contributions from this component to a separate image plane.

Refraction Label:
    #id: refractlabel

    Specifies a label for the refraction BSDF. This can be used to export
    contributions from this component to a separate image plane.

Reflect:
    #id: reflect

    Controls the amount of reflection output.

Refract:
    #id: refract

    Controls the amount of reflection output.


Roughness:
    #id: rough
    Controls how dull a surface appears. A value of `0.0` results in a smooth surface with perfectly sharp reflections. A value of `1.0` produces a completely dull surface.

    This simulates microscopic bumps which become more pronounced the higher the __Roughness__, causing reflected light to be scattered more.

Anisotropic Bias:
    The direction and amount of anisotropy in the specular highlight. Values less than 0 will sharpen the
    specular highlight in the U direction while values larger than 0 will sharpen the specular highlight
    in the V direction. When the Specular Anisotropy is -1 or 1, highlights will have a width of 0 in one of
    the anisotropic directions.

Anisotropic Angle:
    The angle to rotate anisotropic specular highlights. A value of 0 will align it directly with
    the parametric directions while other angles rotate clockwise. 

Index of Refraction:
    #id: ior
    A relation of Inside material IOR to Ouside material IOR, for example, 
    for Water in Vacuum it is 1.33/1.00 = 1.33

    Higher values reflect more light and bend refraction rays more.

    The impact on reflectivity is strongest on surfaces facing directly towards the viewer. Surfaces facing less directly towards the viewer generally reflect more light, regardless of this parameter's value.

    NOTE:
        The shininess of a surface also depends greatly on its __Roughness__.
