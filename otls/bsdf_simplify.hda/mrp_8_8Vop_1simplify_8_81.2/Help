=CG BSDF Simplify=

Beeing compared to Phong model, this one have a much narrower peak and longer tail at some time.

Do not forget to multiply resulting BSDF to value near 0.35 for metals to avoid too bright albedo.
For dielectrics, if recommended values of Fresnel0 parameter are used, total albedo is already in plausible range.

@parameters

Roughness:
    Roughness of a surface. Zero means "almost ideal" mirror, One is very rough surface.
    Values more than one are allowed, but will have bad sampling and very dark due to large shadowing term

Anisotropic Bias:
    The direction and amount of anisotropy in the specular highlight. Values less than 0 will sharpen the
    specular highlight in the U direction while values larger than 0 will sharpen the specular highlight
    in the V direction. When the Specular Anisotropy is -1 or 1, highlights will have a width of 0 in one of
    the anisotropic directions.

Anisotropic Angle:
    The angle to rotate anisotropic specular highlights. A value of 0 will align it directly with
    the parametric directions while other angles rotate clockwise. 

Fresnel0:
    Reflectance of a surface absolutely perpindicular to light (and viewer)
