= MRP Thin Dirty Glass =

Shader, imitating double-sided glass with light absorbtion inside glass width and applying dirt on top on it's surface.

Instead of refraction, opacity is used to speedup and optimize rendering process.

@parameters
Roughness:
    Glass surface roughness

Index Of Refraction:
    Relation of outside IOR to inside IOR (for air/glass transition it is approximately equal to 1.5)

Transmittance Color:
    Transmittance color of glass

At Distance:
    At which distance glass transparency should reach value in Transmittance Color

Glass Width:
    Glass width in meters

Dirt Mask:
    Mask to apply dirt bsdf. Value of 1 means dirt covering glass with 100%

Dirt BSDF:
    BSDF of dirt
