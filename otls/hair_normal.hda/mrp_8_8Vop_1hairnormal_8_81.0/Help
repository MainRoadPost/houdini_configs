=MRP Hair Normal=

Calculated normal for curve. This node is a copy of it's version from SideFX, except the following:
with Do Rounding turned on, in original version normals were generated only for a part of a tube
(+-45 degrees from direction to the viewer). In this node surface will be more correct, without cutted edges
(+-90 degrees from direction to the viewer).

@inputs

nI:
    The incident direction ray used in the calculation of the curve normal.

nT:
    This is the vector tangent to the curve (hair).

ss:
    This is the u texture coordinate attached the curve (hair) primitive.


@parameters

bow:
    This is the Do Rounding toggle. If on, it causes the curve to have an interpolated normal.


@outputs

hairNn:
    A normal vector for use with hair lighting models.
