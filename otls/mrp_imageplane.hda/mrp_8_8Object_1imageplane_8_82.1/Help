        If toggled camera window offset affects image plane to make image plane follow the offset of camera frame.

    Extra Translate:
        Useful if image plane is used as a ref card. You can add extra offset to image plane with this param.

    Extra Scale:
        Useful if image plane is used as a ref card. You can add extra scale to image plane with this param.

    Rotate:
        Useful if image plane is used as a ref card. You can add extra rotation to image plane with this param.

    Left Crop:
        Crops the image plane from the left side

    Right Crop:
        Crops the image plane from the left side

    Bottom Crop:
        Crops the image plane from the bottom

    Top Crop:
        Crops the image plane from the top

    Render Visibility:
        Render visibility flag. Default is primary, this make Image plane visible onlu in camera, not affecting reflactions, shadows or any other secondary lighting effect.

    Ogl Hq Lighting:
